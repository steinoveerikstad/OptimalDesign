# Optimization in marine systems design

It is assumed that the readers have a basic understanding of main concepts in optimization and operations research, as well as familiarity with tools such as Excel and Matlab. For details on algorithms, such as Simplex, an appropriate textbook should be consulted.

This book contains four main parts:

* Part 1 Introduction to linear optimization
* Part 2 Post-solution analysis
* Part 3 Integer and binary models
* Part 4 Marine systems modelling cases
* Part 5 Transportation problems
* Part 6 Non-linear optimization
* Part 7 Genetic algorithms
