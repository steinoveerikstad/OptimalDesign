<h1 id="Optimization-in-marine-systems-design">Optimization in marine systems design<a class="anchor-link" href="#Optimization-in-marine-systems-design"> </a></h1><p>It is assumed that the readers have a basic understanding of main concepts in optimization and operations research, as well as familiarity with tools such as Excel and Matlab. For details on algorithms, such as Simplex, an appropriate textbook should be consulted.</p>
<p>This book contains four main parts:</p>
<p>Part 1 Introduction to linear optimization
Part 2 Post-solution analysis
Part 3 Integer and binary models
Part 4 Marine systems modelling cases
Part 5 Transportation problems
Part 6 Non-linear optimization
Part 7 Genetic algorithms</p>
